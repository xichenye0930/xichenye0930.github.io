  I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://ai.fudan.edu.cn" target="_blank">College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence</a>,
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://www.fudan.edu.cn" target="_blank">Fudan University</a>,
  where I am co-advised by
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://cjinfdu.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Cheng Jin</a>
  and
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://weizhonz.github.io" target="_blank">Prof. Weizhong Zhang</a>.
  Prior to joining Fudan, I earned my Master’s degree from the
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://cs.shu.edu.cn" target="_blank">School of Computer Engineering and Science</a>
  at
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://www.shu.edu.cn" target="_blank">Shanghai University</a>,
  under the supervision of
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JGm4z4YAAAAJ" target="_blank">Prof. Xiaoqiang Li</a>
  and
  <a class="bio-link" href="https://www.shu.edu.cn/info/1611/75785.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Weiqin Tong</a>.

  My research focuses on Efficient and Trustworthy Machine Learning (e.g., sample selection, data attribution, and noisy label learning)
  as well as its applications (e.g., diffusion models).
  I have published several papers in top-tier conferences, including ICML, NeurIPS, and CVPR.
  Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in my work or want to collaborate on research projects.
